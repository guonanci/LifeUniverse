Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep.
Dreaming about the things that we could be.
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard.
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting starts
I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I~I~I-I feel something so right
When doing the wrong thing
I-I-I-I feel something so wrong
When doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
...
I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter world
Make that money
Watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned

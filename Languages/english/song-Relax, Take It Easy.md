song-Relax, Take It Easy.md

Mika 米卡

Took a ride 搭着火车
to the end of the line where
No one ever goes 去到那个无人去过的旅途尽头
Ended up
on a broken train with nobody I know 这辆破败的火车上，没有一位我认识的朋友
But the pain
and the longings the same where the dying
Now I'm lost and I'm screaming for help
Relax' take it easy
For there's nothing that we can do
Relax' take it easy
Blame it on me or blame that on you
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire
Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?
Relax
There's an answer to the darkest times
It's clear
we don't understand but the last thing on my mind
Is to leave you
I believe that we're in this together 我相信，我们还会相聚
Don't scream 不要尖叫（意味着害怕）

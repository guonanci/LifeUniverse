At your worst, you're the best
Baby I don't want another version, no
Hard to love, hard to trust
But don't change
Don't be a better person for me
'Cuz I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
So don't turn on the light
You're bad, this is good as it gets 你的坏，对我来说刚刚好
I don't want nobody perfect, no 我要的不是完美的人才
And I want to go deeper, down with you
So pull me beneath the surface
Even at your worst, I love you hard 即使你是如此的坏，我也要狠狠的爱
If you wanna keep me, go too far 若你对我还有所留恋，就不要离开
Even if it hurts, I want your heart
'Cuz I'm in love with your dark side
I don't want another version
Don't turn on the light
And stay with me tonight

小缺点、阴暗面，别打开灯光照亮自己的黑暗

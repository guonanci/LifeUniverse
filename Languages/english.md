The Danger of Silence
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement, states, "In the end,
we will not remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.".

As a teacher, I've internalized this message. Every day, all around us, we see the consequence of silence manifest
themselves in the form of discrimination, violence, genocide and war. In the classroom, I challenge my students to
explore the silences in their own lives through poetry. We work together to fill those spaces, to recognize them, to
name them, to understand that they don't have to be sources of shame. In an effort to create a culture within my
classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences, I have four core principles posted on
the board that sits in front of my classroom, which every student signs at the beginning of the year:

read critically, write consciously, speak clearly, tell your truth.

And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point, tell your truth. And I realized that

If I was going to ask my students to speak up, I was going to tell my truth, and be honest with them about the times
where I failed to do so.

So I tell them that growing up, as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans, during Lent I was always taught the most
meaningful thing one could do was to give something up, sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you
understand his sanctity.
I've gave up soda, McDonald's, French fries, French kisses, and everything in between.
But one year, I gave up speaking.

I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice, but it was like
I hadn't realized that I had given that up a long time ago.
I spent so much of my life telling people the things they
wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to. Told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I
still had to figure out being my own, so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything, appeasing ignorance with my silence,
unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence.

When Christian was beat up for being gay, I put my hands in my pocket, and walked with my head down as if I didn't even
notice. I couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I had put on my lips When
the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing.

I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one. When the woman at the
fundraising gala said "I'm so proud of you. It must be so hard teaching those poor unintelligent kids," I bit my lip,
because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity.

We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.

Silence is the residue of fear. It is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue. It is the air retreating
from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.

Silence is Rwandan genocide.

Silence is Katrina.

It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left.

It is the sound after the noose is already tied.

It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.

There is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you. I will not let silence wrap itself
around my indecision.

I will tell Christian that he is a lion, a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance. I will ask that
homeless man what his name is and how his day was, because sometimes all people want to be is human.

I will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau,
and just because you watched one episode the "The Wire", doesn't mean you know anything about my kids.

So this year, instead of giving something up, I will leave every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my
tongue, a stage on the underside of my inhibition.

Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've ever needed is your voice?

We dont 'move on' from grief. We move forward with it.
In a talk thats by turns heartbreaking and hilarious, writer and podCaster Nora Mclnerny shares her hard-earned wisdom
about life and death. Her candid approach to something that will, lets face it, affect us all, is as liberating as it is
gut-wrenching. MOse powerfully, she encourages us to shift how we approach grief. 'A grieving person is going to laugh
again and smile again', she says, 'They're going to move forward. But that doesn't mean they've moved on.'

RECORDED AT TEDWomen
So, 2014 was a big year for me, did you ever have that, just like a big year, like a banner year?
For me, it went like this: October 3, I lost my second pregnancy. And October 8, my dad died of cancer. And then November
25, my husband Aaron died after three years with stage-four glioblastoma which is just a fancy word for brain cancer. So,
I'm fun(Laughter)
People love to invite me out all the time. Packed social life.Usually, when I talk about this period of my life, the
reaction I get is essentially: (Sighs) 'I can't -- I can't imagine'. But I do think you can. I think you can and I think
you should, because, someday, it's going to happen to you. Maybe not these specific losses in this specific order or at
this speed, like I said, i'm very fun and the research that I've seen will stun you: everyone you love has a 100 percent
chance of dying.(laughter) And that's why you came to TED.(Laughter)(Applause)So, since all of these have happened, I've
made a career to talk about death and loss, not just my own, because it's pretty easy to recap, but the losses and tragedies
that other people have experienced.
It's a niche, I have to say.It's a small niche, and I wish I made more money, but...(Laughter)I've written some very
uplifting books, host a very uplifting podcast, I started a little nonprofit. I'm just trying to do what I can to make
more people comfortable with the uncomfortable, and grief is so uncomfortable. It's so uncomfortable, especially if it's
someone else's grief. So part of that work is this group that I started with my friend Moe. who is also a widow; we call
it the Hot Young Widows Club.(Laughter) And it's real, we have membership cards and T-shirts. And when your person dies,
your husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, literally don't care if you were married, your friends and your family are
just going to look around through friends of friends of friends of friends until they fined someone who's gone through
something similar, and then they'll push you towards each other so you can talk amongst yourselves and not get your sad
on other people. (Laughter) So that's what we do. It's just a series of small groups, where men, women, gay, straight,
married, partnered, can talk about their dead person, and say the things that the other people in their lives aren't
ready or willing to hear yet.

Huge range of conversations. Like, 'my husband died two weeks ago, I cant stop thinking about sex, is that normal?'
Yeah, 'What if its one of the Property Brothers?'Less normal, but I'll accept it. (Laughter) Things like, 'Look, when Im
out in public and I see old people holing hands, couples who have clearly been together for decades, and then I look at
them and I imagine all of the things they've been through together, the good things, the bad things, the arguments
they've had over who should take out the trash... I just find my heart filled with rage.'(Laughter)And that example is
personal to me.Most of the conversations that we have in the group cna and will just stay amongst ourselves, but there are
things that we talk about!that the rest of the world -- the world that is grief-adjacent, but no yet grief-stricken --
could really benefit from hearing.

And if you cant tell, I'm only interested in/capable of unscientific studies, so what I did was go to the Hot Young Widows
Club and say, 'Hello, friends, remember when your person died?' They did.'Do you remember all the things people said to
you?''Oh, yeah''Which ones did you hate the most?'I got a lot of comments,lot of answers, people say a lot of things,
but two rose to the top pretty quickly.
'Moving on.'Now, since 2014, I'll tell you I've remarried, a very handsome man named Matthew, we have four children in our
blended family, we live in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. We have a rescue dog.(Laughter)I drive a minivan,
like the kind where doors open and I don't even touch them.(Laughter)Like, by any 'mezhure', life is good.I've never said
'mezhure,'I've never once said it that way.(Laughter)I dont know where that came from.(Laughter)I've never heard anyone
else say it that way.It looks like it should be said that way, and thats why the English language is trash, so...(Laughter)
So impressed with anyone who, like, speaks it in addition to a language that makes sense -- good job.(Laughter)But by any
measure...(Laughter)By any measure, life is really really good, but I havent 'moved on' I havent moved on, and I hate that
phrase so much, and I understand why other people do.Because what it says is that Aaron's life and death and love are
just moments that I can leave behind me -- and that I probably should. And when I talk about Aaron, I slip so easily into
the present tense, and Ive always though that made we weird. And then I noticed everybody does it.And its not because we
are in denial or because we're forgetful, its because the people we love, who we've lost, are still so present for us.

So, when I say, 'Oh, Aaron is...'Its because Aaron still is.And its not in the way he was before,which was much better,and its
not in the way that churchy people try to tell me that he would be.Its just that hes indelible,and so he is present for me.

Here,hes present for me in the work that I do, in the child that we had together. in these three other children Im raising,
who never met him, who share none of his DNA,but who are only in my life because I had Aaron and because I lost him. He
is present in my marriage to Matthew, because Aarons life and love and death made me the person that Matthew wanted to marry.
So Ive not moved on from Aaron,Ive moved forward with him.(Applause)We spread Aarons ashes in his favorite river in Minnesota,

and when the bag was empty -- because when you're cremated, you fit into a plastic bag -- there were still ashes stuck to
my fingers. And I could have just put my hands in the water and rinsed them,but instead, I licked my hands clean, because I
was so afraid of losing more than I had already lost,and I was so desperate to make sure that he would always be a part of me.
But of course he would be.Because when you watch your person fill himself with poison for three years,just so he can stay
alive a little bit longer with you,that stays with you.When you watch him fade from the healthy person was the night you
met to nothing, that stays with you.When you watch your son, who isnt even two years old yet. walk up to his fathers bed on
the last day of his life,like he knows whats coming in a few hours,and say, 'I love you, All done, Bye, bye.'That stays
with you.Just like when you fail in love. finally, like really fail in love with someone who gets you and sees you and
you even see. 'Oh, my God. Ive been wrong this entire time.Love is not a contest or a reality show -- its so quiet.Its this
invisible thread of calm that connects the two of us,even when everything is chaos.When things are failing apart,even when
hes gone.'That stays with you.We used to do the thing,because my hands are always freezing and hes so warm where I would take
my ice-cold hands and show them up his shirt...press them against his hot bod.(Laughter)And he hated it so much,(Laughter)
but he loved me,and after he died,I laid in bed with Aaron and I put my hands underneath him and I felt his warmth.And I
cant even tell if my hands were cold,but I can tell you that I knew it was the last time I would ever do that.And that
that memory is always going to be said.That memory will always hurt.Even when Im 600 years old and Im just a hologram(Laughter)

Just like the memory meeting him is always going to make me laugh.
Grief doesnt happen in this vacuum,it happens alongside of and mixed in with all of these other emotions.So,I me Matthew,my
current husband -- who doesnt love that title(Laughter)but its so accurate.(Laughter)I met Matthew and ...there was this audible
sigh of relief among the people who love me, lie. 'Its over! she did it. She got a happy ending, we can all go home. And
we did good.'And that narrative is so appealing even to me,and I thought maybe I had gotten that, too.but I didnt.I got
another chapter.And its such a good chapter -- I love you honey,its such a good chapter.But especially at the beginning,
it was like an alternate universe, or one the those old 'choose you own adventure' books from '80s where there are two parallel plot lines.

So I opened my heart to Matthew,and my brain was like,'Would you like to think about Aaron?Like, the past,the present,
future,just get in there.'and I did.And all of a sudden,those two plots were unfurling at once,and falling in love with Matthew
really helped me realize the enormity of what I lost when Aaron died.And just as importantly,it helped me realize that
my love for Aaron and my grief for Aaron,and my love for Matthew, are not opposing forces.They are just strands to the
same thread.Theyre the same stuff.Im...what would my parents say?Im not special(Laughter)They had four kids.they were
like...frankly.(Laughter)But Im not.Im not special,I know that,Im fully aware that all day, every day, all around the
world, terrible things are happening.All the time,like I said,fun person.But terrible things are happening,people are
experiencing deeply formative and traumatic losses every day.And as part of my job,this weird podcast that I have,I sometimes
talk to people about the worst thing thats ever happened to them.And sometimes, thats the loss of someone they love,
sometimes days ago or weeks ago, year ago, even decades ago.And these people that I interview,they havent closed themselves
around this loss and made it the center of their lives.Theyve lived,their worlds have kept spinning.But theyre talking
to me, a total stranger,about the person they love who has died,because these are the experiences that mark us and make
us just as much as the joyful ones.And just as permanently.Long after you get your last sympathy card or your last hot dish.

Like, we dont look at the people around us experiencing lifes joys and wonders and tell them to 'move on.' do we?We dont
send a card thats like, 'Congratulations on your beautiful baby.'and then five years later, think like, 'Another birthday party?Get
over it.'(Laughter)Yeah we get it, hes five(Laughter)Wow(Laughter)But grief is kind of one of those things, like, falling
in love or having a baby or watching 'The Wire' on HBO,where you dont get it until you get it, until you do it. And once you
do it,once its your love or your baby,once its your grief and your front row at the funeral,you get it.You understand what
youre experiencing is not a moment in time,its not a bone that will reset,but that youve been touched by something chronic
.Something incurable.Its not fatal, but sometimes grief feels like it could be.And if we cant prevent it in one another,
what can we do?What can we do other than try to remind one another that some things cant be fixed,and not all wounds are meant
to heal?We need each other to remember, to help each other remember,that grief is multitasking emotion. That you can and will
be sad, and happy;youll be grieving and able to love in the same year or week.the same breath.We need to remember that
a grieving person is going to laugh again and smile again.If theyre lucky, theyll even find love again.But yes, absolutely, theyre
going to moved forward.But that doesnt mean that theyve moved on,Thank you.

Success is a continuous journey
In this typically candid style, Richard St. John reminds us that success is not a one-way street, but a constant journey.
He uses the story of his business rise and fall to illustrate a valuable lesson -- when we stop trying, we fail.
Filmed February 2009.

Why do so many people reach success and then fail?One of the big reasons is,we think success is a one-way street.So we do
everything that leads up to success,but then when we get there. We figure weve made it, we sit bank in our comfort zone,
and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.And it doesnt take long to go downhill. And I can tell you
this happens, because it happened to me.Reaching success,I worked hard, I pushed myself.But then I stopped,because I figured,
'Oh,you know,I made it.I can just sit back and relax.'Reaching success,I always tried to improve and do good work.But then
I stopped because I figured, 'Hey, Im good enough.I dont need to improve any more.'Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming
up good ideas.Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.But then I stopped,because I figured I was hot-shot
guy and I shouldnt have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.And the only thing that came was creative block,
I couldnt come with any ideas.Reaching success,I always focused on clients and projects,and ignored the money.Then all this money
started pouring in.And I got distracted by it.And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,
when I should have been talking to my clients.And reaching success,I always did what I loved.But then got into stuff that
I didnt love,like management.Im the worlds worst manager,but I figured I should be doing it,because I was,after all the
president of the company.Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head,and here I was, outwardly very successful,
but inwardly very depressed.But Im a guy,I know how
to fix it.I bought a fast car.(Laughter)It didnt help,I was faster but just as depressed.So I went my doctor.I said,'Doc,
I can buy anything I want.But Im not happy,Im depressed.Its true what they say,and I didnt believe it until it happened
to me.But money cant buy happiness.'He said,'No.But it can buy Prozac.And he put me on anti-depressants.And yeah,the black
could faded a little bit,but so did all the worth,because I was just floating long,I couldnt care less if clients ever called.
(Laughter)And clients didnt call(Laughter)Because they could see I was no longer serving them,I was only serving myself.
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.Well,it didnt take long for business to
drop like a rock.My partner and I,Thom,we had to tell all our employees go,it was down to just the two of us,and we were about to go
under.And that was great.Because with no employees,there was nobody for me to manage.So I went back to the projects I loved.
I had fun again,I worked harder and,to cut a long story short,did all the things that took me back up yo success.But it
wasnt a quick trip,it took seven years.But in the end,business grew bigger than ever.And then I went back to following these
eight principles,the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.And I woke up one day and I said,'I dont need Prozac anymore.'
And t threw it away and havent needed it since.I learned that success isnt a one-way street.it doesnt look like this,it
really looks like this.its a continuous journey.And if we want to avoid 'success-to-failure-syndrome', we just keep following
these eight principles,because that is not only how we achieve success,its how we sustain it.So here is to your continued success,
Thank you very much.

The journey across the high wire
Even a death-defying magician has to start somewhere. High-wire artist Philippe Petit takes you on an intimate journey from his first
card trick at age 6 to his tightrope walk between the Twin Towers.

This sound, this smell, this sight, all remind me of the campfires of my childhood, when anyone could become a storyteller
in front of the dancing flames.
There was this wondrous ending, when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison. It was dreaming time.

Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming, although Im known to make my dreams come true. Last year, I created an one-man
show. For an hour and a half I shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity, how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the
impossible. And then TED challenged me: "Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?" (Laughter) Eighteen minutes,
clearly impossible. But here I am one solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable, every second
will have its importance and hope to God the audience
will be able to follow me. No, no, no. No, the best way for me to start is to pay my respect to the gods of creativity.

So please join me for a minute of silence. Okay, I cheated, it was a more 20 seconds. But hey, we're on TED time.

When I was 6 years old, I fell in love with magic. For Christmas I got a magic box, and a very old book on card manipulation.

Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box.

The difference between healthy and unhealthy love

be in an unhealthy relationship - with a romantic partner, a friend, a family member - and shares the things you can do
every day to love with respect, kindness and joy. "While love is an instinct and an emotion, the ability to love better
is a skill we can all build and improve on over time," She says.

sci-fi trilogy `The Three Body Problem`, author Liu Cixin presents the dark forest throry of the universe.

When we look out into space, the theory goes, we're struck by its silence. It seems like we're the only ones here. After
all, if other forms of life existed, wouldn't they show themselves? Since they havent, we assume there's no one else out
there.

一般现在时态 Simple Present tense
I go to lunch. Do you mean you're going for lunch now?

必须苦练出最正确的发音

I have gone to Shanghai. (电话上沟通)
Are you looking for me?Sorry, I have gone to Shanghai(so you can't find me.)
I went to Shanghai.(I am back.)
I have seen a carrot.(I know its color.)
I saw a carrot.(I'm not lying!)
一般过去时态（照片），过去进行时态（照片） 过去完成时态（Past Perfect Tense）：助动词 have 的变位(I/you/we/they/she/he/it had)+动词的过去分词 He tried to find me yesterday afternoon, but I had already gone to Shanghai.
现在完成时态 ：助动词 have 的变位（I/you/we/they have,She/he/it has）+ 动词的过去分词

过去完成进行时态(Past Perfect Progressive Tense)

一般将来时态 Simple Future Tense Future Progressive Tense 将来进行时态 特别确定、笃定；

将来完成时态 will+have+been+动词的现在分词
将来完成进行时态 will +have+动词的过去分词
过去将来 和 现在 没啥关系 常出现于从句
wo
would 的多义：will 的过去式变位，构成时态（I said I would eat a carrot for lunch）虚拟语气(If I were you, I would、礼貌（Would you like）

有变位 需要助动词辅助 16 种时态里有不常用的，有的甚至非常不常用 时间轴上往前往后推一下罢了；动词的一个时间或者一个状态

法语+西班牙语：罗曼系语言、罗曼语族，动词表达将来时态时，动词本身就有变位，法语： Je mange une carotte.我吃胡萝卜（词尾拼写改变），西班牙语：(Yo)como una zanahoria. (Yo)comi' una zanahoria (Yo)comere' una zanahoria ; Je mangeai une carotte 我吃了胡萝卜（书面、文学、修辞，日常表达是用 J'ai mange'）Je mangerai une carotte 我将吃胡萝卜
英语+德语：日耳曼系语言,需要借助助动词 将来时态的表达

动词原形 do 动词过去式 did 动词过去分词 done
go went gone
take took taken
时态变位完全不规则，好在像以上的例子不多，而且因为常用，所以学英语一段时间后就能习惯

「不规则」过去式的「规律」

英文脑是一种说辞，不真实存在，是一种譬喻法。其实，中文和英文同时存在你的脑子里。 红豆、绿豆 儿童

位阶之分 Declarative knowledge;第二阶 Procedural knowledge（语感），大部分的语言知识
会使用，却不一定知道规则 直觉与流畅 母语学习
小孩学自己的母语中文 蜡烛、马克杯 吃饭了吗 吃了、吃过了、吃（语感）

How are you?
see you tomorrow. Thank you so much. 第二阶段的绿豆（英语）

如何停止在脑中翻译半天 好烂的 pun 谐音 bean、been 介系词 to；

使役动词、被动语态、假设语态（超级难的文法）：第一阶的语言知识。比较有意识地依赖文法规则 产出的时候比较耗费脑力与时间去思考（大家最讨厌的翻译） 成人学习者大量仰赖第一阶的语言知识，所以呢就会缺乏语感以及流畅度

第一阶到第二阶的转化过程：Proceduralization 自动化的过程其实就是所谓的停止翻译

如何自动化语言知识哦 单字、文法规则 自动化过程发生在学习者本身的脑子里面（修行在个人）；辅助你引导你自动化 There is,There are

There have a tree in school ???

升级语言知识：需要靠大量的练习

光谱的一端是 guided practice 引导式练习 文法训练、翻译、造句 统统都有个正确的答案

另外一端 conversational practice 开放性问题、沟通练习 强调的是沟通的过程 比较像线上家教平台，跟朋友在沟通，或者今天推荐的 Lingoda 这种平台 能够达成的练习方式

光谱两边的这两种练习方式都有达成的情况下，才有办法升级你的语言知识，达成自动化，慢慢地减少翻译

对于语言学习的定义，有个重新的认知 老师课堂更多传授的是第一阶段

第一阶段自动化的过程才叫做学习语言

会很多的单字、文法

# beat it 退一步海阔天空

Beat it≠ 打它

千万不要把这句话理解成：打它！ 其实这是一句美国俚语，真正的意思是：走开，滚开，少烦我。所以，天王迈克尔·杰克逊的这首“Beat It”，也是在告诫年轻人避免不必要的麻烦，暴力不能解决一切问题，只会伤害到自己。

例句：

You'd better beat it before it's too late.

你最好趁早滚开！

I'm beat≠ 我被打了

当老外对你说：I'm beat，可不要问人家被谁打的，否则太尴尬了！这句话真正的意思是：我非常累。

轻松玩转单词

例句：

I just want to have a rest. I'm beat.

我只想休息一下，我累瘫了！

Beats me≠ 打我

你知道 Beats me 是什么意思吗？其实，它是 It beats me 的省略，表示：我被难住了，我被难倒了，我不理解。而“ 打我”正确的表达是：Beat me。

例句：

What's he saying? Beats me.

他在说什么？我真是搞不懂！

Why does he want such a big car? Beats me!

为什么他想要这么大的车？我真是不理解！

“别管我”英语怎么说？

当你不想被别人打扰，只想一个人静静，那你知道用英语怎么表达 “别管我”吗？可以用以下几种方式表达：

例句：

Just do whatever you want. Never mind me!

做你想做的，别管我！

Leave me alone. I'm busy.

快走开，我忙着呢。

I said don't bother me.

我说了，别烦我！

Stay out of my business.

别管我的事。

Beat It 是美国俚语，这类话在 MJ 歌词中经常使用，例如 Jam，如果纯查词典而不结合语境很容易理解错。Beat It 不一定非要人“走开”，很多时候有“算了吧”这层意思。在这首歌中，意思是不要逞强，争强好胜容易带来更多暴力和伤害，是男子汉有时也应“避开”，用更理智的方式处理纷争。我觉得 MV 将这首歌的精神诠释得很好，告诉广大青少年，没必要非用帮派纷争来耍酷或证明对错，退一步海阔天空。

MV 比较贴合这首歌，是在讲帮派斗争。
迈克尔.杰克逊的这首歌巧妙的在于高音 Beat it 的唱法，很多中国人听成「避雷、笔嘞」，其实是两单词连读形式「Beatit」（我调高音量，反复听了几遍，觉得音最高的地方可以唱成 Beatei、Beati，或许会更贴近原唱~），中间的音比较高，是不是需要类似戏腔的发音技巧~同时夹带猫王的屏息式高音，需要比较地道的英语口语发音才能唱出猫王原唱的感觉，猫王是以劝告者、第三人称的口吻唱的，充满力量感和血性地说着那一句「退一步海阔天空，生命安全最重要」，我听出了正义方一种保留原则，生命安全重于一切，不被当前想要立马反击邪恶的愤怒冲昏头脑的退步~

副歌部分给我的感觉有点：「真的是特别不能忍，但是不忍的话自己很有可能会死在枪口下」。其实感觉歌中场景，或许是描述着很多人的情绪是愤怒胜过恐惧，但是呢，只要我们是正义一方，人多势众，暂避锋芒，保留主力。要知道牺牲的人们不会白死，只要剩余的势力养精蓄锐，正义终将战胜邪恶，正义可能会迟到，但是从不缺席。这首歌的摇滚节奏、唱法既理性又热血~ 很多人体会到了这种热血的感觉，而我却更多地接受到了「保持理性」的想法~ 猫王就是猫王~

Hi, welcome back 今天跟大家分享日常交流中，母语者最经常使用的句子，zaharaEnglish 在情境中学习生活口语， now let's get started. 1提议&算了 How does that sound? Oh, That sounds great! 还可以当成一个句型来使用，表示我们去做什么事情怎么样， 一起去...怎么样 How does that sound if we get a cup of coffee right now? 需要寻求对方的确认 What do you say...?基本上就是默认对方是肯定同意的 How does that sound if we grab a bite nearby?一起去附近吃点东西如何 当我们取了咖啡店或者是有时候会因为等位，或者是一道菜要费时很久，这个时候你可能会有两种反应，1Never mind.算了， Just cancel the order.不是表示我不介意 it'll take half an hour to prepare this dish. What are you two arguing about?  Never mind. I don't want to know. 另一个态度和这个很相似，但是意思完全不同。 I don't mind 我不介意 Would you like tea or coffee? I don't mind. Either is fine. How does that sound if we eat out in that fancy restaurant? Sounds great. Let me check it out. The seats are all booked. We need to wait for an hour to get in. Never mind. Let's eat somewhere else. Would you like burgers or sandwiches?

2顺利&感谢 经常要表达：事情进展的很好 I told you everything was going to work out.  ...work out ...发展顺利，事情进展的很顺利
Things have worked out quite well for us. It didn't work out.事情进展的不顺利 I'm sorry it didn't work out.What not work out? I'm seeing her again Thursday. 我很抱歉（你们）进展的不顺利

事情进展的顺利离不开别人对我们的帮助，我们表达感谢：Thank you, Thank you very much. Thanks, Thanks so much（更地道），I really appreciate it 我真的很感激 appreciad（尾部的连读发音）  I apprecaite sb doing..., I really do appreciate you guys staying and helping. I apprecaite what you're doing for me. I owe you one.我欠你一个人情 =owe you a favor. Let me have him. Then I will really owe you one. But you owe me. You owe me big.

You're welcome. I'm glad to hear that everything worked out. Seriously, I owe you one.

If there's sth I can do for ya, just let me know.

遇到一些让人崩溃的事情，发泄、抱怨，找朋友或者家人倾诉一下，we may say
I need to vent 发泄情绪，尤其是愤怒的情绪。被倾诉的对象，we can say, I'm your best friend. You can always vent to me.
I've done nothing wrong. There's nothing wrong with sth/that/doing sth. 那样并没有问题
There is nothing wrong with taking a nap during work 小睡一下
There's(连读) no way 当我们倾诉的时候，朋友可能会说，有没有试着去做些什么来缓解形势，我们可以说 There's no way. There's no way you'll have time for all these tasks. 你不可能有时间完成这么多任务吧

No way.不可以 There's no way I'm letting you drive this car 我绝不会让你开这辆车的

I was so tired at work. My boss caught me napping. And I got told off.大骂一顿 You did nothing wrong.
There is nothing wrong with taking a nap during work
Did you explain the reasons to her? There's no way she'll understand me.

illusion错觉；
don't have nothing meaning

Strictly, grammatically, phrases like this are double negatives and cancel themselves out to form a positive, but people don’t read them that way. The double negative is used for emphasis, so “I don’t have nothing” means “I really don’t have anything”.

The Rolling Stones sang, “I can’t get no satisfaction”. Would “I can’t get any satisfaction” have sounded so potent?

OQ: Why do people use the phrases like 'I don't have nothing' and 'I don't need no money', which actually should mean 'I actually have something' and 'I actually need some money'?
<https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-use-the-phrases-like-I-dont-have-nothing-and-I-dont-need-no-money-which-actually-should-mean-I-actually-have-something-and-I-actually-need-some-money>

Is it correct to say I don't have nothing?
"I don't have anything" is correct. The problem with "I don't have nothing" is that, in English, this breaks the rule against using a "double negative." Another example of a double negative is, "I didn't do nothing."

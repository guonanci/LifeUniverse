we're in the dark, it's getting late
I really should go, he's waiting for me
we both know it's not what it seems
we both know what's between the sheets
I know that it's a secret,
and that I gotta keep it
but I want the lights on,
yeah I want the lights on

and I don't wanna run away anymore
Leave the lights on 公之于世
Leave the lights on 拨开云雾
Leave the lights on 见到阳光

what would they say, what would they do
would it be trouble if they knew

I'm trying hard to make you see
all that you are, is all that I nee

yeah I want the lights on

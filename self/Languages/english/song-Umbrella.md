我有一把强力保护伞，只为你而打开~
而构建这把伞，需要一些时间，呜呼，天将降大任于是人也，比先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤（这句话出自《生于忧患,死于安乐》,选自《孟子·告子下》,是一篇论证严密、雄辩有力的说理散文）。路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索~（屈原《离骚》）
You have my heart
We'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines(not magzines)
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shine, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oauth and I'm stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
These fancy things 新潮
Will never come in between 我们中间
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards 重新洗牌
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath and I'm
It's raining
Ooh, baby it's raining
You can always come into me, come into me 只要需要，我的怀抱随时为你敞开

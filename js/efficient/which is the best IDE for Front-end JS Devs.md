#Atom vs ST

#Atom-material vs ST-Boxy

Atom 给人一种沉浸式的开发体验,但是有的人很喜欢有的人不太喜欢

ST-Boxy 给人的感觉还行

#autosave

Basically, atom is better than st in this way, though you must blur from current file. But st auto-save is too sensitive, though we can set seconds to save automatically

By the way, we can also leave auto-save when coding, but I think it help a lot when debugging...

#markdown highlighting

atom is much better than st

#jsx

atom is better than st, in grammar.

#Other

Atom 会在 sidebar 的地方用文件颜色 标明git-status...这一点 ST 就没有

  不多说,现在我就转战 Atom,,,哈哈哈

#Packages

Incompatible Package Detected
language-babel has detected the presence of an incompatible Atom package named 'react'.

It is recommended that you disable either 'react' or language-babel

Reason:

The Atom community package 'react' (not to be confused
with Facebook React) monkey patches the atom methods
that provide autoindent features for JSX.
As it detects JSX scopes without regard to the grammar being used,
it tries to auto indent JSX that is highlighted by language-babel.
As language-babel also attempts to do auto indentation using
standard atom API's, this creates a potential conflict.

#paste

auto indent when paste

#sidebar
Command k b or Command |

#Command Shift T
its great for me like chrome, thanks atom team.
#duplicate
it can replace copy paste but cut in sidebar-file-right-click

#atom 的Command P 有记忆功能  棒棒哒

#lowercase uppercase
autocomplete: on  就不用担心大小写问题了...记得用好 tab 和 enter 就行


#上下或者左右两个窗口排列很方便嘛...哈哈哈
